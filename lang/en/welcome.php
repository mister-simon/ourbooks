    {.text-center}**Once upon a time...**\n
    We made a giant spreadsheet of all our books. That was a good day.\n
    Our books stopped being a scattered unmanaged library. We could browse our books, make recommendations to each other, and even collaboratively rate and review the books we shared.\n
    Unfortunately the spreadsheet was cumbersome to manage on mobile, conditional formatting and formulas were janky, and it became difficult to search and sort to find what we wanted quickly.\n
    {.text-center}*Our needs had outgrown our tools.*\n
    **After many hours of work and rounds of prototyping from fresh, here we are, ready to share OurBookstop with you!**
